# every_lang
An attempt to stitch as many languages as possible together to make something that may or may not work. 
I will focus on languages I am not yet familiar with, and expand from there.
(I will also try to sprinkle in cool tech here and there!)

## Ideas
- Front end -> *elm*
- Back end -> *golang*
- Database -> *Mongo*
- Runtime container -> *Docker*
